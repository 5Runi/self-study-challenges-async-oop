# Friday Challenge Problems: Async + OOP

This repo contains curated **Async** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** challenge problems.  
They are designed to help you:

- Strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Practice writing pseudocode before coding.
- Build clarity in how you structure and explain solutions.
- Prepare for upcoming units, projects, and technical interviews.

## üîπ How to Use

1. **Check which problem set you‚Äôre working on**

   - For **Async**, go to the `async/` folder.
   - For **OOP**, go to the `oop/` folder.

2. **Choose 1‚Äì2 problems** from that folder.

   - Start with pseudocode ‚Üí then implement a solution.
   - Add inline comments to explain your reasoning.

3. **Refactor for clarity**

   - Rename variables and functions to show intent.
   - Replace ‚Äúmagic values‚Äù with named constants.
   - Use early returns (when it improves readability).

4. **Depth over breadth**
   - Completing one problem with clarity and strong reasoning is better than skimming several.

## üîπ Goals

- **Async problems**

  - Practice callbacks, promises, and `async/await`.
  - Get comfortable with chaining outputs and handling timing.

- **OOP problems**
  - Reinforce constructors, prototypes, and object patterns.
  - Practice organizing code for reuse and readability.

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Work solo first, then compare notes with your pod or group.
- Follow the cycle: _pseudocode ‚Üí implement ‚Üí refactor ‚Üí review_.
- Keep notes or reflections
