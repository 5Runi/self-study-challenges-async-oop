/**
 * CHALLENGE 2: Movie
 * Create a class `Movie` that models a movie. Each `Movie` object should
 * contain properties for `title`, `director`, and `releaseYear`, which
 * are set via arguments when the object is created.
 * The class should also have methods `getTitle`, `getDirector`, `getReleaseYear`,
 * and `getDetails` which returns a string combining the title, director, and releaseYear.
